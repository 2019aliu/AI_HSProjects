'''
Assignment:

Determine a regular expression which will match only on the indicated strings, or else will find the indicated
matches. The form for the submission will be a command line script that takes a single integer as input from 31
to 40, inclusive, and outputs the corresponding regular expression pattern, as it was done in class: the pattern is
to be delimited by forward slashes and any options should immediately follow the final slash.

31. Determine whether a string is either 0, 100, or 101.

32. Determine whether a given string is a binary string (ie. composed only of 0 and 1 characters).

33. An integer (sub)string refers to a non-empty (sub)string that will convert to an integer but has no leading 0.
Zero is represented as the single digit 0. Given a binary integer string, what regular expression determines
whether it is even?

34. What is a regular expression to determine (ie. match) those words in a text that have at least two vowels?

35. Given a string, determine whether it is an even binary integer string.

36. Determine whether a given string is a binary string containing 110 as a substring.

37. Match on all strings of length at least two, but at most four.

38. Validate a social security number entered into a field (ie. recognize ddd-dd-dddd where the d represents
digits and where the dash indicates an arbitrary number of spaces with at most one dash). For example,
542786363, 542 786363, and 542 â€“ 78-6263 are all considered valid.

39. Determine a regular expression to help you find the first word of each line of text with a d in it.

40. Determine whether a string is a binary string that has the same number of 01 substrings as 10 substrings.
